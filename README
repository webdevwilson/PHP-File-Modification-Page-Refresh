INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Put the script on your server
2. Embed the script in the head section of your webpage:
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/file-change-refresh.php?p=/path/to/a/file.php"></script>
3. Load the page

QUERY STRING OPTIONS:
p - (optional) comma-separated list of absolute paths of files to monitor (from the site root)
push - (optional) use comet style 'push' AJAX instead of polling (push=1)

NOTES:
- Be careful when using push style, using this on a production site getting traffic is not recommended
- Do not leave this script embedded in your site, it is for development purposes only
- I highly discourage leaving your browser open for long periods of time with this script running
